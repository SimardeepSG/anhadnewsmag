        <text> Frequently Asked Questions:
        <br  /> 
        <br  />
        <b>Do I have to pay to receive a copy of Anhad?</b>
        <br  />
        <br  />
        No! As part of Anhadâ€™s mission to make the magazine accessible, we are providing the magazine for free. We do humbly ask everyone who is buying a copy to donate as printing and packaging each copy costs $11 and international packages cost upward of $30 each.  However, we do prioritize shipping for those packages earlier for individuals who have donated.

        
        <br  /><br  />
        <b>What if I want to order multiple copies?  </b>
        <br  /><br  />If you are an individual ordering multiple copies for your family/relatives and friends, the form will guide your on specifics. 

        <br  /><br  />
        <b>How long does the magazine take to arrive? </b>
        <br  /><br  />The magazine can take anywhere from a few days to a full month. We do provide a tracking number but given that the post office is backed up in the United States and we are a team compiling packages together, we ask for patience! If there are any concerns, please email anhadnewsmagazine@gmail.com. 

        I am ordering the magazine for distribution as an organization/gurdwara. What do I do? 
        Please fill out the organization/distribution form. All instructions and details are provided in the form. We highly recommend organizations/gurdwaras interested in ordering Anhad copies to consider donations for the printing costs of their order. 

        <br  /><br  /><b> How can I donate to Anhad?  </b>
        <br  /><br  />Check out the Donate tab on our website on the top right. BTW, we do have a venmo!
