            <h1>Mission: </h1>
            <p>Anhad is a student-run Sikh print and multimedia magazine that draws upon the Singh Sabha movement’s essence to create spiritual, political, and historical pieces. Through our crowdsourcing model, we seek to inspire a new wave of Sikh literacy and connectedness with our Guru. </p>
            <h1>Vision: </h1>
            <p>As a multimedia discussion starter found in every home, Anhad envisions a literary renaissance elevating Sikh creativity and journalism through an approachable community forum rooted in Gurbani and Sikh principles.</p>
            <h1>Identity: </h1>
            <p> Anhad is the celestial sound heard by the soul after the entrance of the Dasam Duar. It rings monotonously and represents multiple spiritual states as explained in our Granth: living, death, and awakening. It is the sound of the cosmos and human consciousness, transcending space and time–– a sound with no beginning or end. emphasizes divine connectivity and the effort it takes to reach such a high-awareness spiritual state. 
        
                Anhad Magazine hopes to emulate the love a Sikh has for reaching such connectivity and awareness, only to hear God's sound. Our magazine is meant to be a place for Sikhs to use literacy and research to produce new levels of consciousness to understand their creator in an environment of love and growth.
